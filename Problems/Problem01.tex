We need to add the number of apples that Bob and Tony have individually. Let $X$ be the number of apples that Bob has. Let $Y$ be the number of apples that Tony has. Let $T$ be the total number of apples.

\begin{equation*}
T = X + Y
\end{equation*} 

\begin{equation*}
T = 2 + 3 = \boxed{5}
\end{equation*}
