Instructors often rely on What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) word processor applications like Microsoft Word to create student learning assessments such as homework assignments and exams. The shortcomings in this traditional method led to the authorsâ€™ motivation to develop a better method. This project focuses on the development, usage, evaluation, and dissemination of a student learning assessment system based on LaTeX, a document preparation system commonly used for scientific documents. We call it the Student Learning Assessment Modular System (SLAMS). With this system, educators can streamline the assessment creation process. They can standardize outputs using a library of individual problems with integrated solutions. The system outputs a high-quality PDF file with optimum hyphenations, line breaks, and page breaks. Equations, tables, and figures are consistently formatted. The system is modular and flexible to allow the user to use a subset of the features or add new features based on their individual needs.
